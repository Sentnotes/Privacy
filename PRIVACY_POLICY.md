# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: November 9, 2025**

## Introduction

SentNotes, Inc. ("SentNotes", "we", "our", or "us") builds tools that help you track habits, workouts, and wellness goals. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect your information when you use the SentNotes mobile application, our websites, and any related services (collectively, the "Services"). By using the Services you agree to the practices described below.

## Information We Collect

We collect information in three primary ways: (1) information you provide to us directly, (2) information we receive automatically when you use the Services, and (3) information we receive from third parties you authorize.

• Account details such as name, email address, profile preferences, time zone, and subscription status.

• Wellness inputs that you log, including workouts completed, goals, custom notes, and attachments you upload.

• Device and usage data including IP address, device identifiers, app version, crash logs, and feature usage analytics.

• Optional integrations, for example Apple Health or Google Fit metrics that you explicitly connect.

• Support interactions, survey responses, and feedback shared with Alison, our virtual assistant.

## How We Use Your Information

• Provide, personalize, and maintain the Services you request.

• Recommend routines, challenges, reminders, and insights tailored to your goals.

• Deliver customer support, respond to requests, and resolve technical issues.

• Send transactional messages (for example password reset emails or subscription receipts).

• Improve the Services through analytics, testing, and research.

• Enforce our Terms of Use, protect against fraud, and comply with legal obligations.

## Legal Bases for Processing

Where required by law, we rely on the following legal bases to process your information: your consent, fulfillment of a contract with you, compliance with legal obligations, and our legitimate interests in operating and improving the Services. We only rely on consent where it is required, and you may withdraw consent at any time.

## How We Share Information

• Service providers that host our infrastructure, analytics, communication tools, customer support software, and payment processing. These providers may only use the information to perform services on our behalf and must protect it in accordance with this policy.

• Third-party integrations that you choose, such as log-in providers or wellness data sources. We share only the information needed to enable the integration.

• Business transfers if we merge, sell assets, restructure, or undergo financing; in such cases we will notify you and require the successor to honor this policy.

• Legal and safety obligations when we must comply with applicable law, enforce our agreements, protect SentNotes, our users, or the public from harm, or respond to lawful requests from authorities.

## International Data Transfers

SentNotes is headquartered in the United States and uses service providers located in multiple countries. When you use the Services, your information may be transferred to and processed in regions with different data protection laws. We apply safeguards such as standard contractual clauses, data processing agreements, and technical controls to protect your information during these transfers.

## Retention

We keep your information for as long as necessary to provide the Services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, secure our systems, and enforce agreements. When information is no longer needed, we securely delete or anonymize it.

## Your Choices and Rights

• Access, update, or delete your account information from within the app or by contacting support@sentnotes.com.

• Export your data using the account tools or request an export from our support team.

• Opt out of promotional emails by using the unsubscribe link or adjusting notification preferences.

• Control push notifications within device settings and inside the SentNotes notification preferences page.

• Revoke permissions for third-party integrations at any time.

• Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have additional rights (for example the right to object, restrict processing, or lodge a complaint with your local authority). We honor these rights where they apply.

## Cookies and Similar Technologies

We use cookies, device identifiers, and similar technologies to authenticate users, remember preferences, analyze usage, and measure the effectiveness of our communications. You can control cookies through your browser settings. Disabling cookies may limit certain functionality.

## Security

We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your information against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Despite these protections, no system is perfectly secure. We encourage you to use strong passwords, enable device security features, and notify us promptly if you suspect unauthorized activity.

## Children

SentNotes is intended for individuals aged 16 and older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If we learn that we have collected information from a child under 16, we will delete it promptly.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to the Services, applicable law, or privacy practices. When we make material changes we will post an updated date at the top, provide a notice in the app, or obtain consent where required. Please review this policy periodically.

## Contact

If you have questions or requests related to privacy, email us at support@sentnotes.com with the subject line "Privacy Request". Alison, our virtual assistant, will acknowledge your message and the SentNotes privacy team will follow up shortly.
